Mixer
#######

Mixing refers to composing a custom, versioned image of |CLOSIA| for a specific use case. While upstream |CL| provides options to install bundles for various capabilities, some developers and OSVs may wish to either augment the operating system with functionality from their own packages or modify the structure of current bundles. Mixing offers a method to add capabilities while retaining the ability to stay up to date with an upstream version of |CL|.

Mixing is a multi-step process that starts with installing the mixer bundle using swupd. You will also need a working knowledge of :abbr:`RPMs (RPM Package Manager files)` and how |CL| bundles work. For a detailed guide on how to create a |CL| mix, visit :ref:`mixer`.
