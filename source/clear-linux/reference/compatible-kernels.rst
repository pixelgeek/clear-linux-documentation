Compatible Clear Linux\* kernels
################################

The |CLOSIA| provides the following Linux kernels with a respective bundle.
This document describes the specific use cases these `bundles`_ serve
and provides links to their source code.

Kernel native
=============

The *kernel-native* bundle focuses on the bare metal platforms. It is
optimized for fast booting and performs best on the Intel® architectures
described on the :ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`. The
optimization patches are found in our `Linux`_ GitHub\* repo.

Kernel Container
================

The *kernel-container* bundle contains the kernel used by the
Intel® Clear Containers project. This kernel is optimized for
fast booting and performs best on |CC| running on the Intel® architectures
described on the :ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`.
The optimization patches are found in our `Linux-Container`_ GitHub repo.

.. _vm-kernels:

Kernel LTS
==========

The *kernel-lts* bundle focuses on the bare metal platforms but uses the
latest :abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` Linux kernel. It is optimized for fast
booting and performs best on the Intel® architectures described on the
:ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`. Additionally, this
kernel includes the VirtualBox\* kernel modules, see our
:ref:`instructions on using Virtualbox<virtualbox>` for more information.
The optimization patches are found in our `Linux-LTS`_ GitHub repo.

Kernel KVM
==========

The *kernel-kvm* bundle focuses on the Linux
:abbr:`KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)`. It is optimized for fast booting
and performs best on Virtual Machines running on the Intel® architectures
described on the :ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`.
Use this kernel when running |CL| as the guest OS on top of *qemu/kvm*. Use 
this kernel with **cloud orchestrators** using *qemu/kvm* internally as 
their **hypervisor**. This kernel can be used as a standalone |CL| VM, see 
our :ref:`instructions on using KVM<kvm>` for more information. The 
optimization patches are found in our `Linux-KVM`_ GitHub repo.

Kernel Hyper-V\*
================

The *kernel-hyperv* bundle focuses on running Linux on Microsoft\*
Hyper-V. It is optimized for fast booting and performs best on Virtual
Machines running on the Intel® architectures described on the
:ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`.
Use this kernel when running |CL| as the guest OS of **Cloud Instances** in
projects such as Microsoft `Azure`_\*. This kernel can be used in a 
standalone |CL| VM, see our :ref:`instructions on using Hyper-V<hyper-v>` for
more information. The optimization patches are found in our `Linux-HyperV`_
GitHub repo.

Kernel Hyper-V LTS
==================

The *kernel-hyperv-lts* bundle focuses on running Linux on Microsoft
Hyper-V but uses the latest :abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` Linux kernel. It
is optimized for fast booting and performs best on Virtual
Machines running on the Intel® architectures described on the
:ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`.
Use this kernel when running |CL| as the guest OS of **Cloud Instances** in
projects such as Microsoft `Azure`_. This kernel can be used in a standalone
|CL| VM, see our :ref:`instructions on using Hyper-V<hyper-v>` for
more information. The optimization patches are found in our
`Linux-HyperV-LTS`_ GitHub repo.
