Language reference guide
########################

This section describes acceptable usage of the English language in the
|CLOSIA| documentation. It includes information about words use,
punctuation, and grammar. This guide does not replace a professional
writer's review but is intended to help collaborators submit consistent
contributions.

To make translations easier and to make the content accessible to non-native
speakers, |CLOSIA| uses Simple English. However, we have not implemented any
controlled language standards.
