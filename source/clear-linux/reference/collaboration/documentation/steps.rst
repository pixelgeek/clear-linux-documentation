Step-by-step instructions
#########################

* Provide a sequence of numbered steps, see :ref:`lists`. Do not provide a
  paragraph of sentences.

* Describe one action per step.

* If the user needs to do the same thing for several procedures, refer to
  earlier steps rather than repeating them.

* When steps and diagrams flow down a page side-by-side, put text on the left
  and diagrams on the right.

* When steps include commands or code blocks, put the commands or code blocks
  after the step that includes them.

* If directions can appear in only one place, either text or figure, put them
  in the text; don't hide directions in diagrams.

* When a series of steps is supported by one figure, refer to the figure in
  the introductory text: "See Figure 15 and do the following:"

* When a series of steps is supported by two or more figures, avoid referring
  to a range of figures. Rather, refer to a specific figure in the relevant
  step and show the figure immediately after the reference. **Do not write**:
  "See figures 15 through 22 and do the following:"
