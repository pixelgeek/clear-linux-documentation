Install |CL-ATTR| on bare metal (manual)
#############################################

This section contains the steps for a |CL-ATTR| manual installation. It
picks up where the :ref:`bare-metal-install` left off.

To perform additional tasks during the |CL| Installer setup, select the 
:guilabel:`< Manual(Advanced) >` menu option (figure 1).  

* :ref:`Modify the disk layout using the cgdisk utility<cgdisk-manual-install>`
* Add additional command-line parameters to the kernel
* Create a hostname for your system
* Create an administrative user
* Add additional software bundles to enhance the functionality of your
  initial |CL| installation
* Optionally set up a static IP address for your system

Begin the manual installation process
*************************************

#. Move the cursor to the :guilabel:`< Manual(Advanced) >` menu item
   and press the :kbd:`Enter` key.

#. The screen :guilabel:`Choose partitioning method` will
   appear (figure 2).

   If your hard drive has already been partitioned for a Linux system, you 
   can select the :guilabel:`< Use default partition and mount scheme on 
   target device >` menu item and press :kbd:`Enter` to move to the next
   step of the installer setup process.

   .. _cgdisk-manual-setup:

   Otherwise, to set up your hard drive partitions manually before moving to
   the next step, select the :guilabel:`< Manually configure mounts and
   partitions >` menu item and follow the instructions for :ref:`using CGDISK
   to set up your Clear Linux hard drive<cgdisk-manual-install>`.

.. _choose-target-device:

Choose target device for installation
=====================================

The :guilabel:`Choose target device for installation` menu, shown in figure 
3, displays the current device and partition information. In
this example, ``/dev/sda`` is the only drive on the system with three
partitions defined and assigned. The menu cursor highlights the partition
to install |CL| onto.

#. Select the :guilabel:`< Partition /dev/sda >` button and press the
   :kbd:`Enter` key.

   .. note::

      To return to the previous menu, press the :kbd:`Tab` key
      to highlight the :guilabel:`< Previous >` button and press :kbd:`Enter`
      to return to the previous menu.

#. Next, you will be presented with a warning screen (figure 4) with
   :guilabel:`< No >` highlighted by default. If this is the device onto
   which you wish to install |CL|, press :kbd:`Tab` to highlight
   the :guilabel:`< Yes >` button. 

#. Press :kbd:`Enter` to proceed.

Additional manual installer settings
====================================

The next steps of the manual installer setup process allows you to:

* Set up any additional command-line parameters to the kernel.
* Create a hostname for your system.
* Set up an administrative user.
* Install additional software bundles.
* Optionally create a static IP address for your system.

#. The :guilabel:`Append to kernel cmdline` menu shown in figure 5 allows you
   to add more options to the kernel command-line to further customize
   your installation.  Normally this is not required; however, if there are
   specific options that need to be set in the Linux kernel, you can enter
   them here. For a complete list of command-line parameters for the Linux
   kernel you can visit the official documentation of the `latest kernel's
   command-line parameters`_.

   Add any additional command-line parameters in the :guilabel:`Append to
   cmdline:` field and then press the :kbd:`Tab` key to move to the
   :guilabel:`< Next >` button and press :kbd:`Enter`.

#. The :guilabel:`Configuring Hostname` menu shown in figure 6 suggests
   a hostname string prefaced with "clr". You can make your hostname anything
   meaningful and unique. Once complete, press the :kbd:`Tab` key to move to
   the :guilabel:`< Next >` button and press :kbd:`Enter`.

   To learn more about hostname naming conventions and restrictions, you can
   check this `wiki page about hostnames`_.

#. The :guilabel:`User configuration` menu shown in figure 7 allows you to
   create a userid with administrative privileges. If you do not want to 
   create a user at this time, select 
   :guilabel:`< No user creation (login as root) >` to skip this step and
   proceed to the :guilabel:`Bundle selector` menu.

   #. To create a userid, select the :guilabel:`< Create an administrative 
      user >` field and press :kbd:`Enter` to go to the the next screen.
   #. You will be presented with the second :guilabel:`User configuration` 
      menu shown in figure 8. You are only required to fill in the
      :guilabel:`Username`, :guilabel:`Password`, and :guilabel:`Confirm 
      password` fields.
   #. To give a user administrative privileges, press :kbd:`Tab` until
      cursor appears in the field :guilabel:`Add user to the sudoers?` and
      select. This adds the user to the ``wheel`` group and allows entry of 
      the :command:`sudo` command.

      After entering all data, press :kbd:`Tab` until :guilabel:`< Next >`
      is highlighted. Then press :kbd:`Enter`.

#. In the menu :guilabel:`Bundle selector` (figure 9), you can add
   software bundles to your initial |CL| installation. Press the :kbd:`Tab`
   key to highlight additional bundles, and then press :kbd:`Spacebar` or 
   :kbd:`Enter` to select each bundle. This menu will also list the
   additional :guilabel:`--- required ---` software bundles that will be
   installed during the |CL| installation.

For a complete description of the content of these additional bundles, go to
the :ref:`software bundle list <bundles>` and select the name for a
specific bundle to show the contents within the bundle.

Target system network configuration
===================================

Before the actual |CL| installation begins, we must set up the
:guilabel:`Network configuration` shown in figure 10. Select
:guilabel:`< Use DHCP >` to have an IP address automatically assigned when
the system boots up.

   Figure 10: :guilabel:`Network configuration`

You can optionally set up a static IP address for your system.  Select the
:guilabel:`< Use static IP configuration >` menu item and fill in the
required fields.

Begin installation
******************

The |CL| installer is now ready to use the information you provided on the
previous sections to begin the actual installation. Figure 11 shows the
installer's prompt to begin the installation.
