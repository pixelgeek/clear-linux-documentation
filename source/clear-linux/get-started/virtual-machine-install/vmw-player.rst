Install |CL-ATTR| as a VMware\* Workstation Player guest OS
###########################################################

`VMware Workstation 14 Player`_ is a type 2 hypervisor. It runs on top of
another operating system such as Windows\* or Linux\*. With VMware ESXi, you can
create, configure, manage, and run |CL-ATTR| :abbr:`VMs (Virtual Machines)` on
your local system.

This section shows how to create a new VM and install |CL| into it with the
VMware Workstation 14 Player hypervisor. Installing |CL| into a new VM
provides you flexibility when configuring the VM. You can configure the VM's
size, number of partitions, installed bundles, etc.

In this tutorial, we perform the following steps:

   :depth: 1

If you prefer to use a pre-configured |CL| VMware image instead,
see our :ref:`vmw-player-preconf` guide.

VMware offers a type 1 hypervisor called `VMware ESXi`_ designed for the
cloud environment. For information on how to install |CL| as guest OS on
it, see :ref:`vmware-esxi-install-cl`.

.. note::

   The screenshots on this document show the Windows version of the
   VMware Workstation 14 Player. The menus and prompts are similar to those
   in the Linux version save some minor wording differences.

   .. note::
      The |CL| installer ISO needs a minimum of 2GB of RAM.
      After completing installation, |CL| can run on as little as
      128MB of RAM. Thus, you can reduce the memory size if needed.
      See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Go to :guilabel:`Power` and select :guilabel:`Shut Down Guest`.

Enable UEFI boot support
************************

|CL| needs UEFI support to boot. To enable UEFI, add the
following line to the end of your VM's :file:`.vmx` file:

.. code-block:: console

   firmware = "efi"

.. note::

   Depending on the OS, you can typically find the VMware VM files under:

   * On Linux distros: :file:`/home/username/vmware`
   * On Windows: :file:`C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Virtual Machines`

Power on the VM
***************

After configuring the settings above, power on your |CL| virtual machine.

#. On the :guilabel:`VMware Workstation Player` home screen, select your 
   VM. See Figure 13.

   .. figure:: figures/vmw-player/vmw-player-13.png
