Install |CL-ATTR| as a live image
#################################

A live image contains the complete |CL-ATTR| operating system and resides
on a bootable media such as a USB drive or in a virtual machine
(see :ref:`virtual-machine-install`). This is a great way to use |CL| 
without modifying your computer's hard disk.

To create a bootable USB drive with a live image, follow
:ref:`our step-by-step instructions<bootable-usb>` and use the latest |CL|
live image from the `image`_ directory. Look for the
:file:`clear-[version number]-live.img.xz` file.
